# PHP-XAMPP-based-login-system
The PHP language and the xampp web server are used in this project to create a login and register web based system
There is also a little bit of css involved for it to feel like a real database system to.

Also like to thank Dary Nazar for a very helping in learning PHP and about databases for me to create this project.
